  s.description      = <<-DESC
   From the Haskell documentation on the Either type:

   The Either type represents values with two possibilities: a value of type Either a b is either Left a or Right b.

   The Either type is sometimes used to represent a value which is either correct or an error; by convention, the Left constructor is used to hold an error value and the Right constructor is used to hold a correct value (mnemonic: "right" also means "correct").
